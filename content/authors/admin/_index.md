I'm PhD student in Integrative & Biomedical Physiology and Clinical & Translational Sciences (dual-title) at Penn State. I fell in love with all things microbiome during my master's training at the University of Wyoming, and I'm passionate about open source science. I have published shotgun metagenomics, 16S, and ITS sequencing analyses and strive to keep up on newer compositional and statistical techniques. My current research focuses on the interactions of type 2 diabetes, probiotics, and metformin treatment on the gut microbiome & mycobiome. I live in State College, Pennsylvania, and in my spare time I help run a [rescue for giant-breed dogs](www.bigdogshugepaws.com) and I rescue senior Great Danes and mastiffs (and recently, a diabetic cat) with my husband.

Microbiome research is everywhere. Next-gen sequencing data is ubiquitous, and descriptive microbiome studies can be found for every scientific niche. However, this type of ‘omics data is complex and inaccessible to everyday biologists who have only experienced “traditional” stats. This website is intended to serve as a tool for scientists at every level who want to truly demystify and understand the world of microbiome informatics and analyses. Along the way, we’ll tackle some R code to make these analyses easy and reproducible. I’ll include tutorials on publication-ready figures, good coding practices, workflows for bigger data, and doing robust statistical analyses. This website is intended to serve the needs of someone with minimal R and microbiome experience, up to the level of an experienced coder who wants a more in-depth understanding of microbiome analyses.
